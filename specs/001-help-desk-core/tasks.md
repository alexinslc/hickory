# Tasks: Hickory Help Desk System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-help-desk-core/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Tasks focus on implementation with built-in validation via NSwag contract testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md, this is an Nx monorepo with three applications:
- **Backend API**: `apps/api/src/`
- **Frontend Web**: `apps/web/src/`
- **CLI**: `apps/cli/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies, but naturally follows US1
  - US3 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US4 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies, but benefits from existing ticket data
  - US5 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US6 (P3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US7 (P3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies, but benefits from existing ticket data
- **Attachments (Phase 10)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 and US2
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **MVP First (Phases 1-4)**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 (Submit Tickets) ‚Üí US2 (Agent Response)
   - This delivers a working help desk system
   - Users can submit tickets and agents can respond
   - Estimated: 75 tasks (T001-T108)

2. **Enhanced MVP (Phases 5-7)**: Add US3 (Categories/Tags) ‚Üí US4 (Search) ‚Üí US5 (Notifications)
   - Adds organization, discovery, and real-time features
   - Estimated: 82 additional tasks (T109-T186)

3. **Full Feature Set (Phases 8-10)**: Add US6 (Knowledge Base) ‚Üí US7 (Reports) ‚Üí Attachments
   - Adds self-service and analytics capabilities
   - Estimated: 61 additional tasks (T187-T247)

4. **Production Hardening (Phase 11)**: Polish and cross-cutting concerns
   - Estimated: 28 tasks (T248-T275)

**Total: 275 tasks**

### Parallel Opportunities Within Phases

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T006, T007, T008, T009, T010 can all run in parallel after T001

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Many tasks marked [P] can run in parallel:
- Auth setup: T014, T015, T016, T017, T019, T020 in parallel
- Infrastructure: T022, T023, T024, T025, T026, T028, T029 in parallel
- Client setup: T031, T032, T033, T034, T035, T036, T037, T038, T039, T040 in parallel

**User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: If staffed appropriately, entire user stories can be developed in parallel after Foundational phase completes. Within each story:
- Entity creation and configuration tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Handler implementations marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI component creation marked [P] can run in parallel
- Query/mutation implementations marked [P] can run in parallel

**Phase 10 (Attachments)**: Storage provider implementations (T234, T235) can run in parallel

**Phase 11 (Polish)**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T248-T262)

## Parallel Example: MVP Development (Phases 1-4)

Assuming a team of 4 developers:

**Week 1: Setup & Foundational**
- Developer A: Setup tasks (T001-T010)
- Developer B: Auth foundation (T011-T021)
- Developer C: Infrastructure foundation (T022-T029)
- Developer D: Client foundation (T030-T040)

**Week 2-3: User Story 1 (Submit Tickets)**
- Developer A: Backend entities and handlers (T041-T061)
- Developer B: Frontend UI (T062-T069)
- Developer C: CLI implementation (T070-T072)
- Developer D: Testing and validation (T073-T075)

**Week 4-5: User Story 2 (Agent Response)**
- Developer A: Backend handlers and authorization (T076-T091)
- Developer B: Frontend agent UI (T092-T102)
- Developer C: CLI agent commands (T103-T105)
- Developer D: Conflict handling and validation (T106-T108)

**Result**: Working MVP in 5 weeks with parallel development

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 275
- **MVP Tasks (Phases 1-4)**: 108 tasks
- **Enhanced MVP Tasks (Phases 5-7)**: 78 tasks
- **Full Feature Tasks (Phases 8-10)**: 61 tasks
- **Polish Tasks (Phase 11)**: 28 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 150+ tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel

**Independent User Stories**: All 7 user stories can be implemented and tested independently after Foundational phase

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1-4 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2) = 108 tasks = Core help desk functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### Test-First Approach (Not Required for This Feature)

The specification does not explicitly request test-first development. Contract testing is implicitly handled through NSwag-generated clients validated against the OpenAPI specification, ensuring type safety and API contract adherence.

If test-first development is desired, add test tasks before each implementation phase following this pattern:
1. Write contract test (verify against OpenAPI spec)
2. Write integration test (verify user journey)
3. Run tests (should FAIL)
4. Implement feature
5. Run tests (should PASS)

### Type Safety Strategy

- **Backend‚ÜíFrontend**: NSwag auto-generates TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec (T031)
- **Backend‚ÜíCLI**: NSwag auto-generates TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec (T032)
- **Contract Validation**: Generated clients enforce API contracts at compile time
- **No `any` Types**: TypeScript strict mode prevents `any` usage (constitutional requirement)
- **No Nullable Warnings**: C# nullable reference types prevent null issues (constitutional requirement)

### Performance Validation

- **SC-003**: Ticket submission <2 seconds (validate in T075)
- **SC-006**: Agent response <30 seconds (validate in T108)
- **SC-010**: Search results <2 seconds (validate in T163)
- **SC-012**: Attachment upload <5 seconds for 10MB (validate in T247)
- **Overall**: P95 latency targets verified in T273

### Incremental Delivery

Each phase represents a deployable increment:
- **Phase 1-2**: Infrastructure ready, authentication works
- **Phase 3**: Users can submit tickets (half of MVP)
- **Phase 4**: Agents can respond (complete MVP)
- **Phase 5**: Organization with categories/tags
- **Phase 6**: Search functionality
- **Phase 7**: Real-time notifications
- **Phase 8**: Self-service knowledge base
- **Phase 9**: Analytics and reporting
- **Phase 10**: File attachments
- **Phase 11**: Production-ready
