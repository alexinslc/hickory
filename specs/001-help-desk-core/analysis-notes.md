# Analysis Notes: Hickory Help Desk System

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Analysis Command**: `/speckit.analyze`  
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## Summary

The specification analysis identified **0 CRITICAL** issues and **6 total findings** (1 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 2 LOW). The HIGH priority issue (duplicate requirement IDs) has been **FIXED**. The MEDIUM priority items are noted below for implementation.

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ D1 - Duplicate FR-013 (HIGH) - FIXED

**Issue**: Duplicate requirement ID FR-013 used twice  
**Fix Applied**: Renumbered all requirements from FR-013 onwards:
- FR-013 → FR-013 (optimistic locking - kept)
- FR-013 (categories) → FR-014
- FR-014 → FR-015
- FR-015 → FR-016
- FR-016 → FR-017
- FR-017 → FR-018
- ... continued through FR-035 → FR-036

**Result**: All requirement IDs are now unique and sequential.

## Outstanding Items for Implementation

### MEDIUM Priority - Add During Development

#### C1 - Missing Tasks for Ticket Reopening Logic (FR-006)

**Requirement**: FR-006 states "System MUST allow users to reopen closed tickets within 30 days of closure"

**Current State**: Task T078 covers status updates but doesn't explicitly validate the 30-day limit.

**Recommendation**: Add during User Story 2 (Phase 4) implementation:
```
- [ ] T078A [US2] Add 30-day validation for ticket reopening in UpdateTicketStatusHandler
  - Check ClosedAt timestamp
  - If > 30 days, return validation error prompting user to create new ticket
  - Include reference to original ticket ID in error message
```

**Priority**: Implement when working on T078 (UpdateTicketStatus handler)

---

#### C2 - Missing Tasks for Ticket History/Audit Trail (FR-018)

**Requirement**: FR-018 states "System MUST maintain complete ticket history showing all updates, replies, and status changes"

**Current State**: Comments cover replies, but no explicit audit trail for all ticket field changes.

**Recommendation**: Add during User Story 1 or 2 implementation:

**Option 1 - Database Approach**:
```
- [ ] T047A [US1] Create TicketAuditLog entity to track all field changes
- [ ] T047B [US1] Add EF Core interceptor to auto-log ticket updates
- [ ] T063A [US1] Add ticket history timeline to ticket details page
```

**Option 2 - Event Sourcing Approach** (if using MassTransit already):
```
- [ ] T166A [US5] Extend event definitions to include all ticket field changes
- [ ] T166B [US5] Create audit log consumer to persist events
- [ ] T063A [US1] Add ticket history timeline to ticket details page
```

**Priority**: Implement during US1 (T047) or US5 (T166) depending on chosen approach

---

#### C3 - Missing Tasks for Admin User Management (FR-023)

**Requirement**: FR-023 states "System MUST allow administrators to create, modify, and deactivate user accounts"

**Current State**: User entity and authentication exist, but no admin CRUD UI or endpoints.

**Recommendation**: Add as new phase after Foundational or with User Story 7 (Reports):

```
## Phase 2A: Admin User Management (After Foundational)

- [ ] T040A Implement GetAllUsers query handler (admin only) in apps/api/src/Features/Admin/Users/GetAll/
- [ ] T040B [P] Implement CreateUser command handler (admin only) in apps/api/src/Features/Admin/Users/Create/
- [ ] T040C [P] Implement UpdateUser command handler (admin only) in apps/api/src/Features/Admin/Users/Update/
- [ ] T040D [P] Implement DeactivateUser command handler (admin only) in apps/api/src/Features/Admin/Users/Deactivate/
- [ ] T040E [P] Add FluentValidation validators for user operations
- [ ] T040F Create GET /api/v1/admin/users endpoint in apps/api/src/Features/Admin/Users/UsersAdminController.cs
- [ ] T040G [P] Create POST /api/v1/admin/users endpoint
- [ ] T040H [P] Create PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id} endpoint
- [ ] T040I [P] Create DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/{id} endpoint (soft delete)
- [ ] T040J [P] Create admin user management page at apps/web/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx
- [ ] T040K [P] Create user form component at apps/web/src/components/admin/UserForm.tsx
- [ ] T040L [P] Implement admin user queries/mutations in apps/web/src/lib/queries/adminUsers.ts
```

**Priority**: Implement after MVP (Phases 1-4) or with Phase 9 (Reports & Admin features)

---

### LOW Priority - Address If Time Permits

#### A1 - Link Performance Requirements

**Issue**: FR-033 says "responsive performance" without specific criteria

**Fix**: Already handled - SC-009, SC-010 provide specific metrics. Consider adding cross-reference in spec.md:
```markdown
- **FR-033**: System MUST maintain responsive performance as ticket volume grows (see SC-009, SC-010 for specific targets)
```

**Priority**: Polish phase (Phase 11) or leave as-is

---

#### A2 - Clarify Tag Permissions

**Issue**: FR-015 says "agents to add multiple tags" - unclear if users can also tag

**Current State**: Tasks T122-T123 implement agent-only tag operations

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Update spec.md to clarify "Agents can add/remove tags; users can suggest tags"
2. Or keep current agent-only behavior and update FR-015 wording

**Priority**: Polish phase (Phase 11) or leave as-is (agent-only is reasonable default)

---

## Implementation Plan Recommendation

### Phase 1-4: MVP (Current Plan - PROCEED AS-IS) ✅
- Setup (T001-T010)
- Foundational (T011-T040)
- User Story 1: Submit Tickets (T041-T075)
- User Story 2: Agent Response (T076-T108)

**During implementation**:
- When you reach T078: Add T078A for 30-day reopening validation
- When you reach T063 or T166: Add ticket history/audit tasks based on chosen approach

### Phase 2A: Admin Capabilities (ADD AFTER MVP)
- Add T040A-T040L for admin user management
- Estimated: 12 additional tasks, ~1-2 days

### Phases 5-11: Continue as planned ✅
- All other user stories and polish
