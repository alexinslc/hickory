# Feature Specification: Hickory Help Desk System

**Feature Branch**: `001-help-desk-core`  
**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build hickory, a modern, minimal, and fast open-source help desk for IT/DevOps/Software teams (and anyone needing lightweight ticketing). It prioritizes simplicity, speed, and clarity, while offering a crisp UI and a production-worthy architecture that scales from side-project to SaaS"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-26

- Q: What should the SLA target resolution times be for different priority levels? → A: Priority-based but configurable by administrators per deployment
- Q: What is the reasonable size limit per file for ticket attachments? → A: 10MB per file (industry standard, handles most logs and documents), but may adjust higher later
- Q: Which authentication methods must be supported initially? → A: Both OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for SSO and local email/password auth as fallback
- Q: What level of observability is required for production-worthy architecture? → A: Standard: Structured logging + health checks + basic metrics (production-ready, practical)
- Q: How should concurrent ticket editing conflicts be handled? → A: Optimistic locking with conflict detection (safe, notifies user of conflicts, allows retry)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Submit and Track Support Tickets (Priority: P1)

End users need to submit support requests and track their status without requiring complex training or navigating confusing interfaces. They should be able to describe their issue, see confirmation it was received, and check on progress at any time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of any help desk system. Without the ability to create and track tickets, there is no help desk. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a ticket through any interface, receiving a ticket ID, and viewing that ticket's current status and history. Delivers immediate value by providing a structured way to request and track support.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a support issue, **When** they submit a ticket with a description and priority, **Then** they receive a unique ticket ID and confirmation
2. **Given** a user has submitted a ticket, **When** they view their ticket list, **Then** they see all their tickets with current status, priority, and last update time
3. **Given** a user wants to check on a specific ticket, **When** they open the ticket details, **Then** they see the full conversation history, current assignee, and status
4. **Given** a user needs to add information, **When** they reply to their ticket, **Then** their response is added to the ticket and the assignee is notified
5. **Given** a ticket is resolved, **When** the user views it, **Then** they see the resolution and can reopen if the issue persists

---

### User Story 2 - Manage and Respond to Support Tickets (Priority: P1)

Support agents need to efficiently manage incoming tickets, prioritize their work, respond to users, and resolve issues. They need clear visibility into their queue and the ability to collaborate with other agents.

**Why this priority**: Without agent capabilities to respond and resolve tickets, the system cannot function as a help desk. This is equally critical as ticket submission - both are required for the core workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by assigning tickets to an agent, having them respond to users, update ticket status, and close resolved tickets. Delivers value by enabling the support team to actually provide support.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new tickets are submitted, **When** an agent views the ticket queue, **Then** they see all unassigned tickets sorted by priority and submission time
2. **Given** an agent is working on tickets, **When** they claim or are assigned a ticket, **Then** it moves to their personal queue and other agents see it's assigned
3. **Given** an agent needs to respond, **When** they add a reply to a ticket, **Then** the user receives a notification and the ticket shows the response
4. **Given** an agent resolves an issue, **When** they close the ticket with a resolution note, **Then** the user is notified and can provide feedback
5. **Given** an agent needs help, **When** they add internal notes to a ticket, **Then** other agents can see these notes but users cannot
6. **Given** an agent is overwhelmed, **When** they reassign a ticket to another agent, **Then** the new agent is notified and the ticket moves to their queue

---

### User Story 3 - Organize with Tags and Categories (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

Users and agents need to organize tickets using categories and tags to enable filtering, reporting, and routing. This helps teams manage high ticket volumes and identify patterns.

**Why this priority**: While not required for basic ticket submission and response, categorization becomes essential as ticket volume grows. It enables teams to work efficiently and identify recurring issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating predefined categories (e.g., "Hardware", "Software", "Network"), allowing tickets to be tagged, and filtering/searching by these tags. Delivers value by enabling organization and pattern recognition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an organization has defined ticket categories, **When** a user creates a ticket, **Then** they can select the most appropriate category
2. **Given** an agent is processing a ticket, **When** they add relevant tags, **Then** the ticket becomes discoverable through tag-based searches
3. **Given** an agent needs to find related tickets, **When** they filter by category or tag, **Then** they see only tickets matching that classification
4. **Given** a supervisor reviews team performance, **When** they view ticket statistics, **Then** they see volume and resolution time broken down by category

---

### User Story 4 - Search and Find Tickets Quickly (Priority: P2)

Users and agents need to find specific tickets or related issues quickly using search. This reduces duplicate tickets and helps agents reference previous solutions.

**Why this priority**: As ticket volume grows, searching becomes essential for efficiency. However, the system can function without search initially by browsing lists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating tickets with various content, then searching by ticket ID, keywords in description, user name, or status. Delivers value by dramatically reducing time to find relevant information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user remembers some details about their ticket, **When** they search using keywords from their issue description, **Then** they find their ticket in the results
2. **Given** an agent needs to find a specific ticket, **When** they search by ticket ID, **Then** they immediately see that ticket
3. **Given** an agent wants to find similar issues, **When** they search by error message or product name, **Then** they see all related tickets
4. **Given** a supervisor needs audit information, **When** they search by assignee and date range, **Then** they see all tickets handled by that person in that period

---

### User Story 5 - Receive Real-Time Notifications (Priority: P2)

Users and agents need to be notified when tickets are updated so they can respond promptly without constantly checking the system.

**Why this priority**: Notifications significantly improve response time and user satisfaction, but the system can function with manual checking initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating a ticket and verifying that relevant parties receive notifications through configured channels. Delivers value by keeping everyone informed without requiring constant monitoring.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has submitted a ticket, **When** an agent responds, **Then** the user receives a notification with the response summary
2. **Given** an agent is assigned a ticket, **When** the user adds new information, **Then** the agent receives a notification
3. **Given** an agent is assigned a ticket, **When** the assignment happens, **Then** they receive a notification with ticket details
4. **Given** a ticket has been idle, **When** a configured time threshold is exceeded, **Then** supervisors receive an escalation notification

---

### User Story 6 - Self-Service Knowledge Base (Priority: P3)

Users should be able to find answers to common questions without creating tickets, reducing support burden and providing instant solutions.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for reducing ticket volume, the knowledge base is an enhancement that can be added after core ticketing functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating articles, searching for solutions, and measuring reduction in tickets for issues covered by articles. Delivers value by deflecting tickets and empowering users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a question, **When** they search the knowledge base, **Then** they see relevant articles ranked by relevance
2. **Given** an agent has resolved a common issue, **When** they create a knowledge base article, **Then** future users can find and follow the solution
3. **Given** a user is creating a ticket, **When** they type their issue description, **Then** they see suggested articles that might resolve their issue
4. **Given** an article helps a user, **When** they mark it as helpful, **Then** the article's usefulness score increases

---

### User Story 7 - Generate Reports and Analytics (Priority: P3)

Supervisors and managers need visibility into support metrics to measure performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.

**Why this priority**: Reporting is important for optimization but not required for basic operations. Teams can function with manual tracking initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating reports showing ticket volume, average resolution time, agent performance, and trend analysis. Delivers value by enabling performance measurement and process improvement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a supervisor needs to review team performance, **When** they generate a weekly report, **Then** they see ticket volume, resolution time, and agent activity
2. **Given** a manager wants to identify trends, **When** they view the monthly analytics dashboard, **Then** they see ticket trends by category, priority, and time
3. **Given** an executive needs business metrics, **When** they request SLA compliance reports, **Then** they see percentage of tickets resolved within target times
4. **Given** a team lead wants to balance workload, **When** they check agent statistics, **Then** they see ticket assignments and resolution rates per agent

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a ticket is submitted with invalid or missing information?** The system should require minimum required fields (description) and allow submission with reasonable defaults, prompting users to add more details if needed.

- **How does the system handle very high ticket volumes during outages?** The system should continue accepting tickets and queue them appropriately, with clear communication about expected response times during high-volume periods.

- **What happens when an assigned agent leaves the organization?** The system should allow reassignment of all tickets from the departing agent to other team members, preserving full ticket history.

- **How are duplicate tickets handled?** Agents should be able to mark tickets as duplicates and merge them, preserving information from both while preventing fragmented conversations.

- **What happens when two agents try to edit the same ticket simultaneously?** The system uses optimistic locking to detect conflicts; the second agent to save is notified that the ticket was modified and must refresh to see current state before retrying their changes.

- **What happens when a user tries to reopen a closed ticket after a long time?** Users should be able to reopen tickets within a reasonable timeframe, but very old tickets should prompt them to create a new ticket referencing the old one.

- **How does the system handle tickets when users have multiple email addresses or identities?** The system should allow linking multiple identities to a single user account while maintaining security boundaries.

- **What happens when the search index becomes outdated or corrupted?** The system should gracefully degrade to basic filtering and provide administrative tools to rebuild the search index.

- **How are attachments handled when tickets are exported or archived?** All attachments should be included in exports and remain accessible in archived tickets, with clear handling of file size limits.
