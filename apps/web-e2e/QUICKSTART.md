## How to run

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Install Playwright browsers (one-time)

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Step 3: Start the API server

```bash
cd apps/api
dotnet run
```

Wait for: `Now listening on: http://localhost:5000`

### Step 4: Run E2E tests

The Playwright config will automatically start the web server.

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx nx e2e web-e2e

# Run specific test suite
npx playwright test dashboard.spec.ts
npx playwright test authentication.spec.ts
npx playwright test search.spec.ts

# Run with UI (recommended for development)
npx nx e2e web-e2e --ui

# Run specific test
npx playwright test authentication.spec.ts:50

# Run tests matching pattern
npx playwright test --grep "dashboard"
```

## Expected output

## Key Performance Tests

### SC-003: Ticket Submission (<2 seconds)
**Test**: US1.7 in `user-story-1-submit-tickets.spec.ts`

Measures end-to-end ticket submission time:
- User fills form
- Clicks submit
- Waits for redirect to ticket details
- **PASS if**: Total time < 2000ms

Console output:
```
Ticket submission completed in 1247ms (target: <2000ms) ✓
```

### SC-006: Agent Response (<30 seconds) - T108 ✅
**Test**: US2.7 in `user-story-2-agent-manage.spec.ts`

Measures complete agent response workflow:
- Agent navigates to queue
- Finds and opens ticket
- Adds response comment
- Waits for confirmation
- **PASS if**: Total time < 30000ms

Console output:
```
Agent response completed in 5248ms (target: <30000ms) ✓
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Target closed" or "Page closed" errors
**Solution**: Make sure both API and web servers are running

### "TimeoutError: page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded"
**Solution**: Check that web app is accessible at http://localhost:3000

### "Unexpected any" TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Already fixed - all TypeScript errors resolved

### Tests are flaky
**Solution**: 
- Run with `--retries=2` to automatically retry failed tests
- Use headed mode to see what's happening: `--headed`
- Enable debug mode: `--debug`

## Debug Mode

```bash
# Interactive debugging with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test --debug

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test user-story-2-agent-manage.spec.ts:196 --debug

# Run headed (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Slow motion (500ms between actions)
npx playwright test --headed --slow-mo=500
```

## View Test Report

```bash
# After tests complete, view HTML report
npx playwright show-report

# Generate trace for debugging
npx playwright test --trace on
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

## Success Criteria

T108 is considered **PASSED** when:
- ✅ All 17 E2E tests pass
- ✅ US2.7 validates agent can respond within 30 seconds (SC-006)
- ✅ Tests run consistently across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- ✅ Exit code is 0

## What's Covered

### User Story 1: Submit and Track Tickets ✅
- Ticket submission with confirmation
- Ticket list viewing
- Ticket details viewing
- Comment adding
- Form validation
- Navigation flows
- **Performance: <2s submission (SC-003)**

### User Story 2: Agent Manages Tickets ✅
- Queue viewing
- Ticket assignment
- Adding responses
- Status updates
- Closing with resolution notes
- Internal notes
- Complete workflows
- Queue features (filter/sort)
- **Performance: <30s response (SC-006, T108)** 

## CI/CD Integration

The E2E tests are ready for CI/CD. Example workflow is in the README.

```yaml
- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npx nx e2e web-e2e
```

## Next Steps

With E2E tests complete, the MVP testing is done! Only T008 (Docker compose) remains for 100% MVP completion.
